Summarize your solution
-----------------------

* What was your approach to solving the assignment?

First we implemented the crawler. Then we moved onto DictSet and AssocDictList and BST. We wrote test cases sporadically in the middle. Then we connected the crawler and the more efficient data structures.

* Are there any known bugs in your solution?

No known bugs.

We found the idea and funny jokes behind the assignment fun.
