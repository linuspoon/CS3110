Summarize your solution
-----------------------

* What was your approach to solving the assignment?

1. Read the assignment
2. Understand the assignment
3. Figure out what the input was
4. Get the input in a format I can use
5. Use the input to create a game
6. Create functions for each part of the game
7. Create repl to run function continuosly until I win

* Are there any known bugs in your solution?

One bug :( - I thought item points were collected when you picked them up,
not when you dropped them at the treasure location. I found out very late today
that was not the case, and did not have time to change it. I know it's not a
big change in my code, but I don't think it's worth me losing 25% for 2 more
days. Sorry for the bug, hopefully it won't screw up your testing or
automated grading system.

* Should we run your own adventure with your own game engine,
  or would you prefer that we use our game engine (e.g., if you
  know there are significant bugs in your engine, you might
  prefer that we use ours).

  No "significant" errors.

Summarize your testing plan
---------------------------

* How did you test your model?

Played it. A lot. Made everyone who walked past me and said hi play it too.

* How did you test your player-command parser?

Tested bits and pieces of code in utop and then tried compiling and running and
printing outputs.

* How did you test your JSON adventure file parser?

Tested bits and pieces of code in utop and then tried compiling and running and
printing outputs.

* How did you playtest?

Tried all the possible things a person could do at each spot on my medium sized
individual adventure. It was bigger than minimal.json and smaller than gates.json
which made it easier.

* To what extent was your testing automated?

Not at all

Feedback on the assignment
--------------------------

* What was fun about the assignment?

Loved the assignment!

* What did you find especially hard?

Json parsing was a pain in the ass. Spent 3 days trying to make a linked list,
and it was a major waste of my time.

* How could the assignment be made more valuable?

Wish the instructions were a litle clearer on all the individual actions. I know
it was well-written, but it was a pretty large assignment and something along
the lines of an end checklist would have been extremely useful and helpful.

Karma
-----

* What, if any, karma functionality did you implement?

I wrote a cool Harry Potter adventure!!! Hope you like/have read/ have see
Harry Potter :)

* How can the grader access that functionality and test it?

You can access it by loading in adv.json.
